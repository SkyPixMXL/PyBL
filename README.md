# PyBl
PyBL uses mainly the java script language to run the various models. The models offered on this website therefore require no installation and run on all types of device.

This website is still under development. Please let us know if you encounter any problems.

Once you chosen one of the models on this site, clicking on the try button will take you to another web page, where you'll be asked to authorize access to the camera.

Once you've accepted, just wait a few seconds and you'll see the camera return with the changes made by the chosen model.
